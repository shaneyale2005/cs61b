# [UC Berkeley CS61B: Data Structures & Algorithms](https://sp25.datastructur.es/)

## Coursework Overview

This repository contains my coursework for CS61B, the Data Structures and Algorithms course at the University of California, Berkeley. This course covers fundamental concepts in computer science, including data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables), algorithms (sorting, searching, graph traversal), and object-oriented programming principles using Java.

Throughout CS61B, I've had the opportunity to explore and implement a wide array of core computer science concepts, including:

* **Fundamental Data Structures:** Gained hands-on experience with the design and implementation of essential data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees (binary search trees, B-trees), graphs, hash tables, and priority queues. I focused on understanding their underlying principles, performance characteristics, and appropriate use cases
* **Algorithmic Paradigms:** Studied and applied various algorithmic techniques, including sorting (e.g., mergesort, quicksort), searching, graph traversal (e.g., BFS, DFS), dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Emphasis was placed on analyzing algorithm efficiency using Big O notation
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java:** Reinforced and expanded my proficiency in Java, applying OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to build complex and modular systems
* **Software Engineering Best Practices:** Learned about version control with Git, unit testing, debugging strategies, and writing clean, maintainable code

This course has significantly enhanced my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, preparing me for more advanced topics in computer science and practical software development challenges.

## Reflections on Learning

CS61B was a challenging yet incredibly rewarding experience. It solidified my understanding of how to choose the right tools (data structures) and techniques (algorithms) to build efficient and scalable software. The emphasis on rigorous testing and careful design has been particularly valuable.
